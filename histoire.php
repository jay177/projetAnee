                <h1>the tower</h1>
                <p>"The Tower" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments.<br> It is permeated by an element called "Shinsu", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. <br>It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. <br> is because ascension from one floor to the next is only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength,<br> dexterity and wit. Regulars are any individuals from the Outer Tower chosen to climb the tower in the Inner Tower. <br>Former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. <br>Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the "10 Great Families",<br> which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.

                <br>Each floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, <br>an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. <br>Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed "worthy" of doing so by Headon, <br>the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. <br>Such people are referred to as "Chosen Regulars" in Tower of God. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown "Outside" by portentous, <br>impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. <br>Such people are called "Irregulars" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.
                
                According to the author, <br>each floor is the size of the North American continent. Each floor often has its own culture,<br> language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower.<br>
                
                Only Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal.<br> Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.
                
                </p>

                <h1>Shinsu</h1>
                    <p>Shinsu , roughly translated as "Divine Water", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. <br>On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. <br>However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. <br>High Shinsu resistance is required to enter these floors. <br>Residents in the tower must form a contract with the "administrator" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu.<br> However, individual known as "Irregulars" seem to be an exception to this case,<br> with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor.<br>

                    Shinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements.<br> Bang is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. <br>The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu.<br> The size of the units is called Myeon , and the concentration is called Soo . <br>Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower.<br> Shinsu reinforcement  is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars.<br> Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. <br>It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu.<br>
                    
                    Shinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. <br>Using this flow to attack is called flow control. <br>Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. <br>Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. <br>Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control.<br> Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.
